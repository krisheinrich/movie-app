# Angular Movie App

This single page application lets users search for information on movies and TV shows using data provided by the Open Movie Database (http://www.omdbapi.com). The app is built with Angular JS and uses Angular's routing and http services to dynamically manage and display data as the user navigates within the app.

_Update (5/17): The OMDb API has gone private and no longer provides free data to the public._
